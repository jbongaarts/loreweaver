# Agent & Contributor Guide

Single source of operational guidance for AI agents (Claude Code, Codex) and
humans. `CLAUDE.md` just imports this file — keep shared guidance here only so
the two can't drift. Issue-tracker workflow and the mandatory session-close
protocol are in the **Beads Issue Tracker** / **Session Completion** sections
below.

## Build & Test

Monorepo (npm workspaces): `@eshyra/core` + `@eshyra/cli`.

```bash
npm ci             # clean install (CI)
npm install        # local install
npm run build      # tsc --build (incremental)
npm run clean      # tsc --build --clean (removes dist AND .tsbuildinfo)
npm run typecheck  # tsc --build --force (deterministic full build; used by CI)
npm run test       # vitest run
```

Expected: **all non-skipped tests pass.** The suite skips by default the
live-API integration tests (`model.integration.test.ts` and
`campaignBibleFaithfulness.integration.test.ts`, both gated off unless a real
provider key is supplied) and any Dolt-gated checkpoint tests when the `dolt`
binary is absent. Treat exact pass/skip counts as approximate — they grow with
the suite; the gate is that nothing outside those documented skips fails. (As a
rough current baseline the suite is ~239 tests across 37 files.)

**Deterministic builds / core-alone boundary proof:** `tsc --build` is
incremental and keys off `packages/*/tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`. Deleting only
`dist/` leaves a stale `tsbuildinfo`, so `tsc` reports up-to-date, emits
nothing, and exits 0 — a false negative for any proof that builds `@eshyra/core`
alone and asserts `packages/core/dist/index.js` exists. Always reset with
`npm run clean` (clears `dist` **and** `tsbuildinfo`) before such a proof, or
use `npm run typecheck` (`--force`). CI uses `--force` for this reason.

**Native dep — `better-sqlite3` (the only compiled dependency):** use
**Node 24 LTS**. ADR 0008 makes Node 24 the supported runtime and keeps the
root/workspace engines at `>=24 <25`. Keep `@types/node` on 24.x while that
engine range is in force. The workspace uses `better-sqlite3` 12.x because that
line ships Node 24 prebuilds. CI pins Node 24, sets
`npm_config_build_from_source=false`, and runs the CLI install smoke on Linux,
Windows, and macOS. A `better-sqlite3` source-build fallback is a regression
unless a bead explicitly changes the runtime/native support policy. Fallback
for local development: install a C++ toolchain and `npm rebuild better-sqlite3`.
Full rationale:
`docs/adr/0008-node-runtime-and-native-sqlite-support.md` and the header
comment in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Dependency Updates

Dependency updates must follow `docs/dependencies.md`. Keep dependency PRs
separate from feature work and importer parser changes. Treat `better-sqlite3`
updates as runtime/native-sensitive: verify Node 24 compatibility, preserve the
`npm_config_build_from_source=false` CI assumption, and do not take major
updates without a bead that explicitly reviews the Node/runtime decision. Keep
semver-major `@types/node`, `@biomejs/biome`, and `typescript` updates manual
or separate from routine dependency groups so runtime and toolchain policy
changes cannot ride along unnoticed.

## Formatting & Linting

Biome is the canonical formatter/linter for JS/TS source files. Do not
introduce a second formatter for these file types; do not manually reformat code
to fight Biome's output.

```bash
npm run format        # apply Biome safe fixes, formatting, and import organization
npm run format:check  # check Biome format/lint/import rules without writing
npm run lint          # run Biome lint rules
npm run check         # CI-style Biome validation (format + lint, no writes)
```

Run `npm run check` before opening or updating any PR that touches source files.
The full config is in `biome.json`; existing style warnings are tracked there
and addressed incrementally — do not suppress them with inline ignores without
a reason.

The root scripts run repo-wide (`biome … .`), not against narrowed package
allowlists, so newly added root-level files stay covered. Biome honors
`.gitignore` via its VCS integration (`vcs.useIgnoreFile: true`), so build
output, `node_modules`, local DBs, worktrees, and other gitignored paths are
excluded automatically. The only non-gitignored exclusions are declared
explicitly and narrowly in `biome.json` `files.includes`: `coverage`, the
committed `package-lock.json`, and the generated SRD rules-packs under
`packages/core/data`. Do not widen `.gitignore` just to hide a file from Biome;
add a narrow, intentional `files.includes` exclusion only for genuinely
generated/vendored paths. `packages/core/test/nodeRuntimePolicy.test.ts` guards
this policy (repo-wide scripts, VCS ignore boundary, and the explicit
exclusions).

### Hidden / Bidirectional Unicode

GitHub shows a noisy "This file contains hidden or bidirectional Unicode text"
warning on diffs that triggers on a broad range of Unicode content, so it is not
a reliable signal for manual review. Instead, CI blocks only the small set of
genuinely dangerous invisible / directional control characters via
`scripts/check-hidden-unicode.mjs` (`npm run check:hidden-unicode`, also run as
the first step of `npm run check`). The script scans git-tracked text files
(`.ts/.tsx/.js/.mjs/.cjs/.json/.jsonc/.md/.ps1/.yml/.yaml/.txt/.sql`) and fails on
bidi embedding/override controls (`U+202A..U+202E`), bidi isolates
(`U+2066..U+2069`), zero-width characters and directional marks
(`U+200B..U+200F`), the Arabic Letter Mark (`U+061C`), the BOM / zero-width
no-break space (`U+FEFF`), the soft hyphen (`U+00AD`), and the combining
grapheme joiner (`U+034F`). Benign visible Unicode punctuation — em dash, en
dash, arrows, curly quotes, degree sign and the like — is allowed and never
flagged. Unlike Biome, this check deliberately **does** scan the generated SRD
rules-packs under `packages/core/data`: that is the path most likely to carry
PDF-extracted text and therefore the exact class of hidden/bidi control this
gate exists to catch. Biome's `suspicious.noIrregularWhitespace` is set to `error` as
supplemental protection, but the dedicated script is the primary guard because
Biome does not scan every relevant file type. The behavior is covered by
`packages/core/test/hiddenUnicodeCheck.test.ts`.

## Agent Worktree Workflow

Keep parent-checkout preflight cheap; run full verification only from the
linked worktree being modified.

Fetch `origin/main` before creating a worktree:

```powershell
npm run agent:preflight
```

This refreshes the base ref only. Do not run full
verification from the parent checkout: do not run Biome, tests, build,
typecheck, or package verification merely to prove `main` is clean. CI keeps
`main` clean.

After creating a linked worktree, immediately enter it and normalize to its git
root:

```powershell
Set-Location .worktrees/<worktree-name>
Set-Location (git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
```

Run all install, edit, format, lint, test, build, and verification commands from
that directory. Before commit/push, run full verification there, not from the
parent checkout:

```powershell
npm run verify:worktree
```

The helper resolves the active git root. It runs
`npm run format` (`biome check --write .`) for safe fixes and import
organization, then runs the repo checks and tests. The npm commands wrap
`scripts/agent-preflight-main.ps1` and
`scripts/verify-current-worktree.ps1`, respectively.

Full `npm run verify:worktree` is required before commit/push. It may be run
earlier when a task specifically needs a clean baseline, but agents should not
treat full verification as mandatory immediately after creating a worktree. The
cheap parent-checkout preflight plus CI-clean `origin/main` is sufficient to
start work.

If Biome says no relevant files were checked because `.worktrees` is ignored,
the command ran from the wrong checkout. The parent checkout's `.worktrees/`
directory remains ignored; do not make Biome scan nested worktrees. In
response, do not delete or recreate the worktree. Enter the intended worktree,
run `Set-Location (git rev-parse --show-toplevel)`, and rerun verification.

## Architecture

Text-first, persistent AI Dungeon Master for long-running fantasy campaigns;
UI-agnostic TypeScript core with a thin CLI. Full strategy in
`docs/architecture-report.md` and `docs/adr/0001-product-model-deployment-content-strategy.md`.
Load-bearing principles:

- Keep rules/mechanics, campaign/module content, live state, user-private
  content, and generated memory separate.
- Deterministic math/dice/canon writes go in tools; narration and rulings go
  through the DM model under bounded-context orchestration.
- SQLite is the live per-turn store; Dolt is only for checkpoint/history/branch
  work off the per-turn path.
- Model access sits behind provider adapters + capability profiles (Claude
  Agent SDK is one adapter, not a core assumption).
- Primary DM targets premium frontier quality; cheaper models are
  auxiliary/experimental unless validated.

## Conventions

- All task tracking via beads (see below) — never TodoWrite or markdown TODOs.
- Bundled/public content must be open-licensed, public domain, original, or
  publisher-licensed; fair use is not the permission model.
- Native VTT, native mobile, hosted billing, and custom/local primary-DM
  replacement are out of early scope absent a new decision record.
- `@eshyra/core` has two import paths and they are **not** interchangeable:
  the root export (`packages/core/src/index.ts`) is the stable public surface
  for external consumers; `@eshyra/core/internal`
  (`packages/core/src/internal.ts`) re-exports movable internals with **no**
  compatibility promise. Production callers (the CLI today, hosted/PWA
  consumers tomorrow) should depend only on the root. The `/internal` subpath
  is for co-developed callers inside this repo (e.g. tests that assert against
  implementation details). New core symbols default to internal — promote to
  the root export only when a real consumer needs the API.

## Non-Interactive Shell

Always pass non-interactive flags so aliased confirmation prompts can't hang
the agent: `cp -f`, `mv -f`, `rm -f` / `rm -rf`, `apt-get -y`, and
`ssh`/`scp -o BatchMode=yes`.

## Git & PR Workflow

Completed work is integrated to `main` by pull request, not by direct pushes to
`main`. Agents should work on a feature branch, run the relevant quality gates,
commit, push the branch, open a PR targeting `main`, and hand off the PR URL for
review.

Routine agent handoff stops at an open PR. Do not merge the PR yourself unless
the user explicitly asks you to merge after review/check requirements are
satisfied. The generated Beads session-completion block below still requires
pushing so work is not stranded locally; in this repository that means pushing
the feature branch and opening the PR for review.

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

**Architecture in one line:** issues live in a local Dolt DB; sync uses `refs/dolt/data` on your git remote; `.beads/issues.jsonl` is a passive export. See https://github.com/gastownhall/beads/blob/main/docs/SYNC_CONCEPTS.md for details and anti-patterns.

### Issue Prefix Migration (Completed)

All live beads issues now use the `eshyra-*` prefix. The migration from `loreweaver-*` was completed via `bd rename-prefix eshyra`, which renamed 381 issues.

- **Live work:** All current issues use `eshyra-*` (e.g., `eshyra-r00`, `eshyra-bo2`, `eshyra-tf8`).
- **Historical references:** Old commits, branches, and chat logs may mention `loreweaver-*` IDs; map them to current issues by replacing only the prefix with `eshyra-` and preserving the suffix (e.g., `loreweaver-r00` → `eshyra-r00`).
- **Configuration:** The beads database `issue_prefix` is `eshyra`, and `allowed_prefixes` is `eshyra` only. `.beads/config.yaml` keeps repository-local settings such as `sync.remote`; it does not control the active issue generator prefix for this existing database.
- **Database name:** `.beads/metadata.json` `dolt_database` remains `loreweaver` (internal historical name, separate from issue prefix).

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

### Deterministic rules-pack importer work

When touching SRD importer, extractor, parser, audit, generated rules-pack, or importer test files, follow `docs/importer-fix-protocol.md`.

This applies to changes under:

- `packages/core/scripts/importers/`
- `packages/core/test/importers/`
- `packages/core/data/rules-packs/`
- SRD audit/oracle code such as `packages/core/src/rules/srdAudit.ts`

Do not weaken regression tests or audit expectations to match current generated output. Fix the importer, extractor, or parser behavior, or document source-backed evidence that the expectation was wrong.
