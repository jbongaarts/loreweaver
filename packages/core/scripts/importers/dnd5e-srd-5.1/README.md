# D&D 5e SRD 5.1 Importer

Deterministic extractor for the D&D 5th Edition System Reference Document 5.1
(CC-BY-4.0). Reads a vendored PDF, extracts canonical `RulesRecord`s, and
writes a `manifest.json` + `records.json` pair compatible with
`loadRulesPackFromDirectory`.

Tracked work: beads `loreweaver-0m9.5` (remaining unimplemented kinds are
tracked as child issues).

## Scope today

| Record kind | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| `spell`     | Implemented. Stat-block parser extracts name, level, school, ritual flag, casting time, range, components (incl. material text), duration, description, and "At Higher Levels" upcast text. Class lists are cross-referenced from the class-spell-list section. |
| `action`    | Implemented. Parser extracts the 10 standard SRD combat actions (Attack, Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, Use an Object) from the combat-actions section into `kind=action` records with `data.description`. |
| `creature`  | Implemented (317 records: 296 monsters + 21 NPCs). Stat-block parser extracts every creature from the Monsters section AND Appendix MM-A into `kind=creature` records satisfying the `dnd5e-srd` creature kindSchema: `size`, `type` (subtype parenthetical preserved; validation applied to the bare type word), `alignment`, `armorClass`, `hitPoints`, `speed` (mode→feet map; the unlabeled base speed keyed as `walk`), `challengeRating` (bare fraction/integer), and `abilityScores`. A stat block is confirmed by its size/type/alignment meta line plus the AC/HP/ability-table signature. **Appendix MM-B: Nonplayer Characters** (the 21 generic NPC stat blocks — Acolyte, Bandit Captain, Berserker, …) is imported too (loreweaver-bn0): an NPC stat block has the identical shape and is equally encounter-usable, so it emits under the same `creature` kind via the same parser, distinguished by a `data.category: 'npc'` discriminator. Monster records carry no `category` field — its absence means "monster" — so the 296 monster records stay byte-identical and the two coverage baselines never mix. Section anchors: `monsters` (`startHeading: /^Monsters$/`, `requireEndHeading: true`), `miscellaneousCreatures` (Appendix MM-A, best-effort), and `nonplayerCharacters` (Appendix MM-B, best-effort start, runs to EOF). `runImporter` fails closed via two independent coverage guards: an empty Monsters parse always throws, the real import (CLI + `verify:dnd5e-srd-pack`) validates monster names against the exact `EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_CREATURE_NAMES` set (296) and NPC names against `EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_NPC_NAMES` (21) — any missing, renamed, or spuriously-extracted entry throws by name (`CreatureCoverageError` / `NpcCoverageError`) and writes nothing (loreweaver-0m9.5.14, loreweaver-bn0). Both sets are reviewed, checked-in regression baselines (the monster candidate is generated via `npm run generate:dnd5e-srd-creature-names`, reviewed against the SRD source, then committed), not runtime-derived expected data. Fixture pipelines that exercise a reduced Monsters section omit the exact sets and rely on the empty-result guard or the coarse `minCreatureCount` floor; a fixture without an MM-B appendix degrades to zero NPCs. |
| `class`     | Implemented (base classes only). Parser keys off each base class's "Hit Dice: 1dN per <class> level" signature line and reads the labeled proficiency / saving-throw lines from its Class Features block into `kind=class` records satisfying the `dnd5e-srd` class kindSchema (`hitDie`, `armorProficiencies`, `weaponProficiencies`, `savingThrowProficiencies`, best-effort `primaryAbilities`). Section anchor: `classes` (`startHeading: /^Classes$/`, `endHeading: /^Using Ability Scores$/`, `requireEndHeading: true`). `runImporter` fails closed via a class-coverage guard (`MIN_EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_CLASSES`). `primaryAbilities` is filled from the Multiclassing "Prerequisites" listing (see `parseMulticlassing.ts`) because the Class Features block prints no key-ability line (ADR 0007); this enrichment is best-effort, so a class absent from that listing keeps an empty array and a PDF without a locatable Multiclassing section is not a failure. Subclasses and class features are separate kinds (ADR 0009). |
| `subclass`  | Implemented. Parser extracts the 12 SRD 5.1 subclasses (one per base class: Champion, Life Domain, School of Evocation, …) from the same Classes-chapter slice by exact heading-name match (after whitespace normalization, so column-spaced multi-word headings like `School   of   Evocation` still match) into `kind=subclass` records. Each links to its parent base class via `data.parentClass` (the `class:<slug>` key — data-side linkage per ADR 0009, never `overrides`) and carries the subclass body prose in `data.description`. Base-class names bound a subclass's description so the next class's intro prose cannot bleed in; a gray callout-box heading (the generic class/DM sidebars printed after a subclass's last feature — Wizard "Your Spellbook", Warlock "Your Pact Boon", Paladin "Breaking Your Oath", Druid "Sacred Plants and Wood"/"Druids and the Gods") also bounds the description by its distinct font-height tier. The dedicated class-callout parser owns that bounded prose and emits it as a standalone parent-qualified `rule` record rather than leaving it inside the subclass (loreweaver-6fw, loreweaver-0m9.5.23). `runImporter` fails closed via a subclass-coverage guard: an empty subclass parse (or a count below `minSubclassCount`, which the CLI sets to `MIN_EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_SUBCLASSES`) throws `SubclassCoverageError` and writes nothing. Granted features are separate `feature` records. |
| `feature`   | Implemented. Parser extracts class- and subclass-granted features from the Classes-chapter slice into `kind=feature` records satisfying the `dnd5e-srd` feature kindSchema (`data.source` keyed to the grantor `class:<slug>` / `subclass:<slug>`, integer `data.level`, `data.description`). Grantor context is tracked by known base-class and subclass names (the same anchors `parseSubclasses` uses). Feature identity and grant level come primarily from class/subclass progression-table rows; leading prose clauses like "At 3rd level" are used only as a fallback when no table anchor exists. Unanchored title-case option subheadings inside feature bodies remain in the parent feature description, but a gray callout-box heading (a generic class/DM sidebar at its own font-height tier, e.g. Wizard "Your Spellbook" after Overchannel) bounds the last feature's body. The dedicated class-callout parser owns that bounded prose and emits it as a standalone parent-qualified `rule` record rather than leaving it inside the feature (loreweaver-6fw, loreweaver-0m9.5.23). `runImporter` fails closed via a feature-coverage guard: an empty feature parse (or a count below `minFeatureCount`, which the CLI sets to `MIN_EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_FEATURES`) throws `FeatureCoverageError` and writes nothing. Shares the `classes` slice (ADR 0009 / loreweaver-0m9.5.18). |
| `background`| Implemented (**1 record**, eshyra-0m9.17). The SRD 5.1 "Backgrounds" chapter (pp60-61) publishes exactly one background, **Acolyte**; `parseBackgrounds` extracts it into a `kind=background` record satisfying the `dnd5e-srd` background kindSchema: re-flowed `data.description`, structured `data.skillProficiencies` (parsed list), optional `data.toolProficiencies` / `data.languages` / `data.equipment` (verbatim grant text, wrapped lines re-joined), the NESTED `data.feature = { name, text }` ("Shelter of the Faithful" — not a top-level `feature` record, because `validateDnd5eFeature` requires a class/subclass grantor key and integer grant level a background feature does not have; mirrors how ancestry traits nest), and `data.suggestedCharacteristics` (the section's intro prose). The entry's four caption-less roll tables (d8 Personality Trait, d6 Ideal/Bond/Flaw) emit as `table` records with synthesized "<Background> <Label>s" names (see Reference-table coverage); the chapter-intro sections emit as `rule` records from a `truncateBeforeFirst(/^Acolyte$/)` sub-slice. An entry is detected at the h≈13.9 sub-subsection tier (heading-case heuristic on uniform-font fixtures) and only counts as a background when a `Skill Proficiencies:` line follows it, so intro headings are never promoted. The real import fails closed against the exact `EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_BACKGROUND_NAMES` set (`BackgroundCoverageError`). Section anchor: `backgrounds` (`startHeading: /^Backgrounds$/`, exact-line end alternation — a prefix `^Equipment\b` would close fixture slices at the entry's own "Equipment:" grant label — `requireEndHeading: true`, best-effort start). |
| `ancestry`  | Implemented. Parser extracts the SRD 5.1 races and subraces by known-name match into `kind=ancestry` records (`data.source = 'race'` per ADR 0005). Parents and subraces are **separate records**; each subrace record is **flattened/self-contained** — its `data.traits` merge the parent's shared traits with the subrace's own additions, with `data.subraceOf` back-referencing the parent and the parent's `data.subraces` listing its children (no `overrides`). Section anchor: `races` (`startHeading: /^Races$/`, `endHeading: /^Classes$/`, `requireEndHeading: true`). |
| `equipment` | Implemented (218 records). Parser projects the Equipment chapter and the Mounts and Vehicles section into per-item `kind=equipment` records, all carrying `category` plus verbatim `cost`/`weight` where the source lists them: armor (13: `ac`, `armorType` from the AC cell, `stealthDisadvantage`, optional `strengthRequirement`), weapons (37: `damageDie`, `damageType`, `properties[]`), tools (35), Adventuring Gear (99) + Tack/Harness/Drawn Vehicles (13) as `category='gear'`, Equipment Packs (7: `category='pack'`, verbatim contents `description`), mounts (8: `category='mount'`, `speed`, `carryingCapacity`), and waterborne vehicles (6: `category='vehicle'`, `speed`). The real SRD 5.1 PDF extracts Armor and Weapons as two physical columns (left/right blocks zipped positionally) while Tools extracts row-major. **Adventuring Gear (loreweaver-4zu)** is the hard case: its left column's item names arrive as one bare run, then the left cost/weight values interleave line-by-line with the right column's complete rows, and four category-header rows (Ammunition, Arcane focus, Druidic focus, Holy symbol) carry no value. Reconstruction removes those four reviewed headers from the name run, then length-checks and zips the de-headered names against the left values (a mismatch throws `EquipmentColumnMismatchError('Gear', …)`); the right column's rows are self-contained. The **Container Capacity** table is attached as a verbatim `capacity` field to the matching gear record via a reviewed name-alias map (an unmatched row throws `ContainerCapacityError`). The Tack table's "Saddle" sub-header variants are qualified to "Saddle, <variant>"; its non-priced "Barding ×4 ×2" multiplier row is skipped. Section anchors: `equipment` (`startHeading: /^Equipment$/`, `requireEndHeading: true`) and `mountsAndVehicles` (`startHeading: /^Mounts and Vehicles$/`; end-bounded by "Trade Goods" but `requireEndHeading` is off because `parseMountsAndVehicles` is internally header-bounded). |
| `magic-item` | Implemented (239 records). Parser extracts the full Magic Items A-Z section into `kind=magic-item` records with `data.itemType`, `data.rarity`, `data.requiresAttunement`, optional `data.attunementRequirement`, and `data.description`. The section is two-column and includes item-specific tables and bullets; `parseMagicItems` keeps those embedded tables in the parent item description instead of emitting standalone `table` records, skips interleaved body/stat/bullet/table lines when locating headings, recognizes category lines that begin after a prose prefix on the same extracted line, and handles category headers whose rarity wraps to a continuation line. The 238 Magic Items A-Z entries are joined by the lone "Artifacts"-subsection entry, **Orb of Dragonkind** (`rarity: "artifact"`, eshyra-0m9.16): it sits after the "Sentient Magic Items" DM guidance that bounds the A-Z slice, so it is sliced and parsed separately by the same `parseMagicItems` and concatenated. The real import fails closed against the exact `EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_MAGIC_ITEM_NAMES` set (239), so missing items or promoted prose/table artifacts throw `MagicItemCoverageError` before writing output. Section anchors: `magicItems` (`startHeading: /^Magic Items A-Z$/`, `endHeading: /^(Sentient Magic Items\|Artifacts\|Monsters\|Appendix)\b/i`, `requireEndHeading: true`) and `artifacts` (`startHeading: /^Artifacts$/`, `endHeading: /^(Monsters\|Appendix)\b/i`, `requireEndHeading: true`, best-effort start). |
| `feat`      | Implemented. Parser extracts feat entries (SRD 5.1: Grappler) with optional prerequisites and description text in `data.description`. Section anchor: `feats` (`startHeading: /^Feats?$\|^Feat Descriptions?$/`, `requireEndHeading: true`). |
| `condition` | Implemented. Parser extracts all 15 SRD conditions (blinded, charmed, deafened, exhaustion, frightened, grappled, incapacitated, invisible, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, prone, restrained, stunned, unconscious). Exhaustion carries a structured `levels` array (6 entries). Section anchor: `conditions` (`startHeading: /^Appendix A: Conditions$\|^Conditions$/`). |
| `hazard`    | Implemented. The canonical SRD 5.1 pack carries **25** `hazard` records from three gamemastering sub-families: **8 sample traps** (loreweaver-hvp: Collapsing Roof, Falling Net, Fire-Breathing Statue, Pits, Poison Darts, Poison Needle, Rolling Sphere, Sphere of Annihilation), **3 sample diseases** (loreweaver-6ra: Cackle Fever, Sewer Plague, Sight Rot), and **14 sample poisons** (loreweaver-6ra: Assassin's Blood … Wyvern Poison). All emit under the `hazard` kind (decision below); the SRD groups Traps with Diseases/Madness/Poisons and each is a description-only danger with a save DC and effects, so they share the `hazard` kindSchema (only `description` is required). They are discriminated within the kind: **traps** carry `data.trapType` (`"mechanical"` \| `"magic"`, the SRD subtitle); **diseases** carry `data.category: "disease"`; **poisons** carry `data.category: "poison"` plus `data.poisonType` (`contact`\|`ingested`\|`inhaled`\|`injury`) and `data.price` (per-dose, from the Poisons reference table). Each carries a re-flowed `data.description` (for poisons, the save DC and damage stay inside the description rather than being parsed out); "Pits" is one trap record describing its four inlined variants. Parsers: `parseTraps` keys each entry off its name line + standalone `Mechanical trap` / `Magic trap` subtitle; `parseDiseases` keys off the exact disease name lines (like `parseHazards`); `parsePoisons` keys off the inline `Name (Type). …` bold lead-in and cross-references the price table by normalized name. The leading guidance prose of the Diseases and Poisons sections (disease/poison framing, the four poison-type definitions) is **not** emitted — DM-facing procedure, not a lookupable entity. The Traps general guidance prose **is** emitted as `rule` records via the `trapRulePages` sub-slice (eshyra-0m9.20): Traps chapter intro, Traps in Play, Triggering a Trap, Detecting and Disabling a Trap, Trap Effects, and Complex Traps. Section anchors: `traps` (end at `Diseases`), `diseases` (`/^Diseases$/`, end at `Madness`), `poisons` (`/^Poisons$/`, end at `Magic Items`), all `requireEndHeading: true`, best-effort start. The real import fails closed against `EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_TRAP_NAMES` / `_DISEASE_NAMES` / `_POISON_NAMES` (a missing/renamed/spurious entry throws `TrapCoverageError` / `DiseaseCoverageError` / `PoisonCoverageError`). The two trap reference tables emit as `table` records (see Reference-table coverage); the Poisons price table is folded into the poison records, not emitted separately. **No `trap` / `disease` / `poison` record kinds:** all three fit the `hazard` kindSchema exactly, and new kinds would force changes across the exhaustive `Record<RulesRecordKind, …>` validators/indexes for no schema benefit. SRD 5.1 has no environmental-hazard chapter (Brown Mold / Green Slime / Webs / Yellow Mold are absent), but the environmental-hazard parser (`parseHazards`, exact-name match, best-effort `hazards` anchor `/^Dungeon Hazards$\|^Hazards$/`) is retained for fixtures and future editions; it emits zero records here. **Extractor note (loreweaver-6ra):** the p205 "Sample Poisons" page is a single column whose entries open with a short indented bold lead-in followed by the justified remainder of the first line on the same baseline; that pattern opened a phantom column gutter that scrambled each poison's first sentence, so `partitionItemsByColumn` now merges such a page back to one column (it straddles ≥2 contiguous baselines with no real gutter, the widest cut is also the most balanced, and the right side owns no standalone line). |
| `table`     | Implemented (**29 records**). The canonical pack contains Difficulty Classes (p77), the two core-rules tables behind excluded captions (eshyra-10t): Ability Scores and Modifiers (p76) and Travel Pace (p84), each anchored on its unique column-header row because both captions also occur as section headings in the core-rules slice, two trap tables (p196), three Madness effect tables (pp201-202), Object Armor Class / Object Hit Points (p203), the six "Beyond 1st Level" reference tables (pp56-59): Character Advancement, Multiclassing Prerequisites, Multiclassing Proficiencies, Standard Languages, Exotic Languages (eshyra-0m9.23), and Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level (p58; eshyra-0m9.18), the five money/downtime tables: Standard Exchange Rates (p62), Trade Goods (p72), Lifestyle Expenses (pp72-73), Food, Drink, and Lodging (pp73-74), and Services (p74) (eshyra-0m9.19), and the four Monsters-chapter reference tables (eshyra-0m9.22): Size Categories (p254, anchored on its unique "Size Space Examples" header because the caption is shared with the un-emitted core-rules p92 Size/Space table), Hit Dice by Size (p256), and the two PAIRED-column tables — Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating (p256) and Experience Points by Challenge Rating (p258) — whose physical lines each carry two logical rows and are rebuilt left-pairs-then-right-pairs so rows run CR 0 → 30, and the four Acolyte suggested-characteristics roll tables (p61, eshyra-0m9.17): Acolyte Personality Traits / Ideals / Bonds / Flaws, emitted by `parseBackgrounds` (not `parseTables` — the SRD prints them caption-less, so their names are synthesized as "<Background> <Label>s" while the column headers keep the verbatim die header text). `EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_TABLE_NAMES` is an exact fail-closed baseline. The parser also retains fixture-only reconstruction rules for XP thresholds and treasure challenge tables, which are absent from this SRD PDF. The Beyond-1st-Level tables come from a dedicated `beyondFirstLevel` section slice; the money/downtime tables come from the `equipment` slice (Standard Exchange Rates) and a dedicated `expenses` slice (the rest), all best-effort on start. Food/Drink/Lodging and Services are printed as grouped tables (sub-headings + indented sub-items); their sub-items fold into qualified item names ("Inn stay (per day)" + "Squalid" → `Inn stay, squalid (per day)`) via a reviewed group→members map, so every row is a standalone purchasable line. See "Reference-table coverage" below (`loreweaver-46m`, `loreweaver-hvp`, `loreweaver-uuk`, `eshyra-0m9.23`, `eshyra-0m9.19`, `eshyra-0m9.18`). |
| `rule`      | Implemented (**256 records**): 127 core rules, 34 spellcasting rules, five focused gamemastering rules (`Madness`, `Going Mad`, `Madness Effects`, `Curing Madness`, and `Objects`), five Classes callouts, the Equipment-chapter `Spellcasting Services` prose rule (eshyra-0m9.19, which has no rate table — the SRD states no established rates exist), the 18 "Beyond 1st Level" chapter rules (eshyra-0m9.18): the chapter-intro advancement prose (`rule:beyond-1st-level`, emitted via `parseRules`'s `chapterIntro` option because the intro precedes any heading in the slice), the Multiclassing subsection tree (Prerequisites, Experience Points, Hit Points and Hit Dice, Proficiency Bonus — parent-qualified to `rule:multiclassing-proficiency-bonus` against the core-rules key — Proficiencies, Class Features, Channel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, Spellcasting), Alignment, Alignment in the Multiverse, Languages, Inspiration, and Gaining / Using Inspiration, the 10 "Magic Items" chapter-intro usage rules (eshyra-0m9.21, from the `magicItemRules` slice, pp206-207, kept separate from the per-item `magic-item` records): the chapter intro (`rule:magic-items`, via `chapterIntro`), Attunement, Wearing and Wielding Items (Multiple Items of the Same Kind, Paired Items), and Activating an Item (Command Word, Consumables, Spells — the casting-from-an-item leaf — and Charges), and the 6 gamemastering Traps general-rules prose records (eshyra-0m9.20, from a `trapRulePages` sub-slice of `trapPages` truncated before "Sample Traps"): the chapter-intro paragraph (`rule:traps`, via `chapterIntro`), Traps in Play, Triggering a Trap, Detecting and Disabling a Trap, Trap Effects, and Complex Traps, and the 44 Monsters-chapter stat-block interpretation rules (eshyra-0m9.22, from a `monsterRulePages` sub-slice of `monsterPages` truncated before the first alphabetic group heading "Monsters (A)"; a reduced fixture without that boundary degrades to no monster rules — `missingBoundary: 'empty'` — and the real import stays fail-closed via `expectedRuleKeys`): the chapter-intro paragraph (`rule:monsters`, via `chapterIntro`), the pp254-260 sections (Size, Type/Tags, Alignment, Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed with Burrow/Climb/Fly/Swim, Ability Scores, Saving Throws, Skills, Vulnerabilities/Resistances/Immunities, Senses with Blindsight/Darkvision/Tremorsense/Truesight, Languages/Telepathy, Challenge/Experience Points, Special Traits with Innate Spellcasting/Spellcasting/Psionics, Actions with Melee and Ranged Attacks/Multiattack/Ammunition, Reactions, Limited Usage, Equipment), the Legendary Creatures tree (Legendary Actions, A Legendary Creature's Lair, Lair Actions, Regional Effects), and the chapter's three h≈10.8 gray callout boxes (Modifying Creatures; Armor, Weapon, and Tool Proficiencies; Grapple Rules for Monsters), and the 6 Backgrounds-chapter intro rules (eshyra-0m9.17, from a `truncateBeforeFirst(/^Acolyte$/)` sub-slice of the `backgrounds` slice — the Acolyte entry heading is h≈13.9, below the heading-flag threshold, so it cannot be a matchHeadings boundary): the chapter-intro paragraph (`rule:backgrounds`, via `chapterIntro`), Suggested Characteristics, Customizing a Background, and the three intro leaves whose bare titles other slices already own — Proficiencies / Languages (Beyond 1st Level) and Equipment (the Monsters chapter) — parent-qualified to `rule:backgrounds-proficiencies` / `-languages` / `-equipment`. The `chapterIntro` name additionally seeds a synthetic tier-0 chapter ancestor (the section anchor consumes the chapter title line), so the seven Monsters sections whose titles other slices already own qualify as `rule:monsters-alignment` / `-armor-class` / `-speed` / `-saving-throws` / `-skills` / `-languages` / `-reactions`, and colliding leaves qualify with their section parent (`rule:senses-blindsight` / `-darkvision` / `-truesight`, `rule:challenge-experience-points`, `rule:special-traits-spellcasting`). The trap and monster reference table captions (both h≈12) are excluded from rule emission by `TABLE_CAPTION_LEAF_TITLES`; the `table` kind owns those records. An excluded caption drops only its table rows (h≈8.9): prose-height lines after the rows are the enclosing section's text resuming below the printed table and re-flow into the preceding rule — this keeps the Hit Points Constitution-modifier paragraph (p256) and also recovered the previously swallowed resuming prose in `rule:ability-scores-and-modifiers` (p76), `rule:ability-checks` (p77), and `rule:speed` (the p84 Travel Pace / Forced March / Mounts and Vehicles prose). `parseRules` remains heading-hierarchy-aware for core/spellcasting/Beyond-1st-Level/Magic-Items/Traps/Monsters chapters, `parseGamemasteringRules` handles the source-shaped Madness root intro and consolidates Objects prose while excluding its two structured tables, and `parseClassCallouts` imports every structurally detected Classes gray box as a standalone rule. Class-callout keys are parent-qualified as `rule:<class-slug>-<callout-slug>`. Semantic filtering is intentionally not performed: procedural, illustrative, and lore boxes are all retained because source structure is the stable inclusion criterion. The real import fails closed against the exact combined `EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_RULE_KEYS` set. Madness and Objects use exact heading anchors with required end headings; their starts are best-effort only so reduced fixtures can omit those sections. Full body text is stored in `data.text`. Diseases and Poisons emit as structured `hazard` records under `loreweaver-6ra`. |

The importer does **not** emit empty stubs for unimplemented kinds. Per the
ADR 0007 ingestion policy and the `loreweaver-0m9.5` scope rule, a generated
pack that omits a kind reflects "the parser doesn't cover that yet" -- not "the
SRD doesn't contain those records". The generated manifest's `description`
field lists the included kinds explicitly so downstream callers can tell.

## How to regenerate

1. The SRD 5.1 PDF is vendored in-repo at
   `packages/core/sources/dnd5e-srd-5.1/SRD_CC_v5.1.pdf` (CC-BY-4.0; pinned by
   SHA-256 in `packages/core/sources/dnd5e-srd-5.1/manifest.json`). No download
   step is required for a fresh clone.
2. From the repo root:

   ```bash
   npm run import:dnd5e-srd
   ```

   This runs against the default vendored PDF path and writes to a scratch
   directory at `packages/core/scripts/importers/dnd5e-srd-5.1/.generated/`.
   It does NOT overwrite the canonical pack location.

3. Inspect the output. When a parser/source/schema change is intended to alter
   pack content, overwrite the committed canonical pack:

   ```bash
   npm run import:dnd5e-srd -- --out packages/core/data/rules-packs/rules__dnd5e-srd-5.1
   ```

   Then review the diff (`npm run audit:rules-pack` / `npm run diff:rules-pack`),
   update the `srdGeneratedPack` baselines, and commit the regenerated pack so
   `npm run verify:dnd5e-srd-pack` returns to exit 0 (see the regeneration
   procedure below).

The CLI prints the source PDF's SHA-256 on each run. The pinned value lives in
`packages/core/sources/dnd5e-srd-5.1/manifest.json` (`artifact.sha256`); a
mismatch means the PDF in `sources/` was swapped without updating the manifest
-- treat that as a vendoring change, not a routine importer run.

## Regenerating the committed pack

Per the 0m9.6 design, the SRD importer is a one-shot construction tool, not a
per-PR generator. The committed pack at
`packages/core/data/rules-packs/rules__dnd5e-srd-5.1/` is the canonical
importer output from the vendored SRD 5.1 PDF (regenerated under
`loreweaver-1pw`). The default vitest suite asserts that committed pack is
well-formed and matches its reviewed baselines
(`packages/core/test/srdGeneratedPack.test.ts`); the importer is **not** re-run
on every PR. Reproducibility against the vendored PDF is a separate, path-gated
CI job (`.github/workflows/srd-importer-reproducibility.yml`) that runs
`npm run verify:dnd5e-srd-pack` and **fails the PR check on any nonzero exit**.

`npm run verify:dnd5e-srd-pack` is the local-and-CI verification command. Its
exit codes are strict:

- `0` — importer output matches the committed pack byte-for-byte (steady state).
- `1` — importer succeeded but its output differs from the committed pack.
- `2` — verification could not produce a meaningful diff (importer/runtime
  failure, pack-loading failure).

When a change to a gated path (importer/parser code, the vendored PDF + its
manifest, the rules schemas/audit/loader, the verify script, or the lockfile)
is intended to alter pack content, regenerate the committed pack in the same
PR:

1. Regenerate over the committed pack location:

   ```bash
   npm run import:dnd5e-srd -- --out packages/core/data/rules-packs/rules__dnd5e-srd-5.1
   ```

2. Review the result with the audit/diff tooling:

   ```bash
   npm run audit:rules-pack -- packages/core/data/rules-packs/rules__dnd5e-srd-5.1
   ```

   `auditPack` must report zero suspicious records. Any partially-populated
   optional field must be a genuinely-optional SRD field — fix the parser, or
   add it to `EXPECTED_PARTIAL_FIELDS` in `srdGeneratedPack.test.ts` with a
   one-line justification, before merging.

3. Update `EXPECTED_COUNTS_BY_KIND`, `EXPECTED_STABLE_KEYS`,
   `EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_MAGIC_ITEM_NAMES`, and `EXPECTED_PARTIAL_FIELDS` in
   `packages/core/test/srdGeneratedPack.test.ts` / `index.ts` to match the
   regenerated pack.

4. Run `npm run verify:dnd5e-srd-pack` and confirm it exits 0. Paste into the
   PR description: the reported source PDF SHA-256 (must match
   `packages/core/sources/dnd5e-srd-5.1/manifest.json` `artifact.sha256`), the
   importer's per-kind counts line, and confirmation that the command exited 0.

- `extract.ts` -- PDF -> per-page text via `pdfjs-dist`. Groups text items by
  y-coordinate (with rounding) and sorts each line left-to-right. Pure
  function over the PDF buffer.
- `sections.ts` -- `PageText[]` -> per-kind `PageText[]` slice via deterministic
  chapter-heading anchors. Fails closed: an unmatched anchor throws
  `SectionNotFoundError` rather than silently feeding the whole PDF to a kind
  parser. See "Section-anchor table" below.
- `parseSpells.ts` -- narrowed text -> `SpellExtraction[]` by scanning for
  level-school marker lines, then walking backward for the name and forward
  for keyed metadata + description. Class lists are a second pass over the
  spell-lists slice.
- `parseActions.ts` -- narrowed text -> `ActionExtraction[]` by exact heading
  match over the 10 standard SRD combat-action names. Body text is re-flowed
  into `description`.
- `parseCreatures.ts` -- narrowed stat-block text -> `CreatureExtraction[]`
  by scanning for each stat block's size/type/alignment meta line, validating
  the type against the 14 SRD creature types, then reading the keyed stat lines
  (Armor Class, Hit Points, Speed, the STR/DEX/… ability table, Challenge). A
  meta-like sentence without the AC/HP/ability signature is skipped; a
  confirmed block missing Speed or Challenge throws. The same parser drives both
  the Monsters chapter / Appendix MM-A (default `category: 'monster'`) and
  Appendix MM-B: Nonplayer Characters (`category: 'npc'`, passed by the
  orchestrator for the MM-B slice — loreweaver-bn0); the `category` argument is
  stamped onto every extraction and surfaces as `data.category` on NPC records
  only.
- `parseConditions.ts` -- narrowed text -> `ConditionExtraction[]` by exact
  match against the 15 known condition names. Bullet-point lines become
  `effects[]`; exhaustion's level table becomes a structured `levels[]` array.
- `parseHazards.ts` -- narrowed text -> `HazardExtraction[]` by exact match
  against the 4 known SRD 5.1 environmental-hazard names (Brown Mold, Green
  Slime, Webs, Yellow Mold). Body is re-flowed prose paragraphs. Emits nothing
  for SRD 5.1 (those hazards are absent from the source).
- `parseTraps.ts` -- narrowed "Traps"-section text -> `TrapExtraction[]` by each
  sample trap's name line + standalone `Mechanical trap` / `Magic trap`
  subtitle. Skips the leading trap-running guidance prose and the two trap
  tables. Body is re-flowed prose; `trapType` records the subtitle. Emitted
  under the `hazard` kind (loreweaver-hvp). The general trap-rules prose is
  imported separately via the `trapRulePages` sub-slice (eshyra-0m9.20) — see
  the `parseRules.ts` entry.
- `parseDiseases.ts` -- narrowed "Diseases"-section text -> `DiseaseExtraction[]`
  by exact match against the 3 known SRD 5.1 disease names (Cackle Fever, Sewer
  Plague, Sight Rot). Skips the leading guidance prose and the "Sample Diseases"
  caption. Body is re-flowed prose. Emitted under the `hazard` kind with
  `data.category: "disease"` (loreweaver-6ra).
- `parsePoisons.ts` -- narrowed "Poisons"-section text -> `PoisonExtraction[]` by
  each sample poison's inline `Name (Type). …` bold lead-in (the four-type
  guidance prose has no parenthetical, so it is not promoted). Price per dose is
  read from the reference-table rows (`Name Type <n> gp`) and attached by
  normalized name. Body is the re-flowed effect prose (lead-in stripped).
  Emitted under the `hazard` kind with `data.category: "poison"`, `poisonType`,
  and `price` (loreweaver-6ra).
- `parseRules.ts` -- narrowed core-rules text -> `RuleExtraction[]`, one per
  heading across the subsection/sub-subsection/leaf font tiers
  (`PageText.lineHeights`), bounding each body at the next heading and
  parent-qualifying colliding keys (loreweaver-yli). Body is re-flowed prose in
  `text`; the disambiguated record-key slug is in `keySlug`. Falls back to a
  flat text-heuristic for uniform-font fixtures.
- `parseAncestries.ts` -- narrowed races text -> `AncestryExtraction[]` by
  known-name race/subrace heading match plus "Label. body" trait detection.
  Emits one entry per race and per subrace; subrace entries carry flattened
  (parent + own) traits and a `subraceOf` back-reference.
- `parseSubclasses.ts` -- narrowed Classes-chapter text (the same slice
  `parseClasses` consumes) -> `SubclassExtraction[]` by known-name subclass
  heading match. Each subclass's body re-flows into `description`, bounded by
  the next subclass heading or base-class name so the next class's prose does
  not bleed in; `parentClass` carries the parent base-class name, which `emit.ts`
  keys to the `class:<slug>` record (ADR 0009).
- `parseFeatures.ts` -- narrowed Classes-chapter text -> `FeatureExtraction[]`
  by class/subclass progression-table anchors plus leading-level prose fallback.
  Progression rows supply the canonical grant level and prevent option
  subheadings inside feature bodies from being promoted to feature records.
- `parseClassCallouts.ts` -- narrowed Classes-chapter text ->
  `RuleExtraction[]` by the same structural heading tiers that bound subclass
  and feature bodies. Every detected gray box is retained as a standalone,
  parent-qualified rule, regardless of whether its content is procedural,
  illustrative, or lore; semantic filtering is intentionally not performed.
- `parseMulticlassing.ts` -- narrowed Multiclassing-section text -> a
  class-name → primary-ability map from the "Prerequisites" listing
  ("Fighter Strength 13 or Dexterity 13", ...). `emit.ts` merges it into each
  class record's `primaryAbilities` when the Class Features block carried none
  (loreweaver-0m9.5.19). Best-effort: a missing section yields an empty map and
  empty `primaryAbilities` rather than a failure (ADR 0007).
- `parseTables.ts` -- narrowed core-rules, Traps, Madness, Objects, and
  treasure-table text ->
  `TableExtraction[]` by per-table anchors plus conservative row
  reconstruction for simple reference tables and column-block reconstruction
  for SRD treasure tables. Rows are emitted as structured arrays in
  `data.rows`.
- `parseGamemasteringRules.ts` -- narrowed Madness and Objects text -> five
  `RuleExtraction` records. It preserves the Madness root introduction,
  separates Going Mad / Madness Effects / Curing Madness, and removes the
  structured Object AC/HP rows from the consolidated Objects prose.
- `parseEquipment.ts` -- narrowed Equipment-chapter text ->
  `EquipmentExtraction[]` for armor, weapons, tools, Adventuring Gear (+
  Container Capacity), and Equipment Packs; `parseMountsAndVehicles` handles the
  separate Mounts and Vehicles slice (mounts, tack/harness/drawn vehicles,
  waterborne vehicles). The real SRD 5.1 PDF lays out the Armor and Weapons
  tables as two physical columns, so each table arrives split into a left
  column-block (Name/Cost/AC or Name/Cost/Damage) and a right column-block
  (Strength/Stealth/Weight or Weight/Properties); the parser collects both and
  zips them positionally. Tools extract row-major. Adventuring Gear interleaves
  its left cost/weight values with the right column's complete rows and carries
  four valueless category headers, so the de-headered left names are
  length-checked and zipped against the left values, the right rows are
  self-contained, and Container Capacity is attached as a verbatim `capacity`.
  Armor weight class is derived from the AC cell (light/medium/heavy/shield),
  not the table sub-headers, which the body prose duplicates. The reconstruction
  fails closed on column drift (`EquipmentColumnMismatchError`) or an unmatched
  container (`ContainerCapacityError`) per ADR 0007 (see the file header).
- `parseMagicItems.ts` -- narrowed Magic Items A-Z text ->
  `MagicItemExtraction[]` by scanning for item category/rarity lines and walking
  backward to the item heading. Handles wrapped names/categories, `rarity
  varies`, two-column interleaving where body lines sit between a heading and
  category, and category substrings that begin after same-line prose prefixes.
  Item-specific tables/bullets remain in the parent `description`; they do not
  emit as freestanding `table` records. The real import validates the exact
  reviewed 237-name set (`EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_MAGIC_ITEM_NAMES`).
- `emit.ts` -- extraction arrays + class index -> validated `RulesPack`,
  written deterministically (records sorted by key, fixed field order, 2-space
  indent, trailing newline).
- `index.ts` -- programmatic API + orchestrator: `runImporter({ pdfPath, outDir })`.
  Dispatches each per-kind slice to its parser.
- `cli.ts` -- command-line wrapper.

## Reference-table coverage

The table parser intentionally covers only cases whose extracted text has a
reviewed deterministic reconstruction rule. Coverage splits into table families
that are **present in the vendored SRD 5.1 source** (and therefore emitted into
the committed canonical pack) and reconstruction rules that are **wired and
tested but match no section in the SRD 5.1 PDF**. The latter emit nothing for
this source; they exist for fixtures and future editions, mirroring the retained
`hazards` / `treasureTables` section anchors (see the section-anchor notes
below). The exact canonical name set is guarded by
`EXPECTED_SRD_5_1_TABLE_NAMES` / `TableCoverageError`.

### Present in the committed SRD 5.1 pack

| Table | Record key | Reconstruction rule |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| Difficulty Classes | `table:difficulty-classes` | Two-column label/DC rows reconstruct cleanly from line text ("Typical Difficulty Classes", p77). |
| Ability Scores and Modifiers | `table:ability-scores-and-modifiers` | Sixteen score-range/modifier rows reconstruct from line text. Anchored on the unique "Score Modifier" header row because the caption is also the chapter's h≈18 subsection title (p76; eshyra-10t). Score ranges keep the SRD en-dash and modifiers the typographic minus sign (U+2212) verbatim. |
| Travel Pace | `table:travel-pace` | Three pace rows whose cells span up to three extracted lines: the numeric row ("Fast 400 4 30 −5 penalty to passive"), the "feet miles miles" units row whose remainder continues the Effect cell, and further Effect wrap lines. Units fold into standalone distance cells ("400 feet", "4 miles", "30 miles"); the Normal "—" effect stays verbatim; the "Difficult Terrain" heading bounds the table. Anchored on the unique "Pace Distance Traveled per . . ." header row because the caption is also the Speed section's prose heading (p84; eshyra-10t). |
| Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses | `table:trap-save-dcs-and-attack-bonuses` | Three-column danger/DC-range/attack-bonus rows reconstruct from line text (p196, gamemastering Traps section; loreweaver-hvp). Cell ranges keep the SRD en-dash verbatim. |
| Damage Severity by Level | `table:damage-severity-by-level` | Four-column level-range/setback/dangerous/deadly dice rows reconstruct from line text (p196; loreweaver-hvp). |
| Short-Term Madness | `table:short-term-madness` | Ten wrapped d100/effect rows reconstruct from the Madness slice (p201). |
| Long-Term Madness | `table:long-term-madness` | Twelve wrapped d100/effect rows reconstruct from the Madness slice (p201). |
| Indefinite Madness | `table:indefinite-madness` | Twelve wrapped d100/flaw rows reconstruct from the Madness slice (p202). |
| Object Armor Class | `table:object-armor-class` | Seven substance/AC rows reconstruct from line text (p203). |
| Object Hit Points | `table:object-hit-points` | Four size/fragile/resilient rows support both inline and split-column extraction layouts (p203). |
| Character Advancement | `table:character-advancement` | Twenty XP/level/proficiency-bonus rows reconstruct from line text; XP thousands separators are stripped to integers (p56; eshyra-0m9.23). |
| Multiclassing Prerequisites | `table:multiclassing-prerequisites` | Twelve class/ability-minimum rows; the value cell keeps its spaces ("Strength 13 or Dexterity 13") because the leading token is a known base-class name (p56; eshyra-0m9.23). |
| Multiclassing Proficiencies | `table:multiclassing-proficiencies` | Twelve class/proficiencies rows whose proficiency cell wraps across extracted lines (the same shape as the Madness tables); rejoined by class-name row starts and bounded by the "Class Features" heading. The Sorcerer/Wizard "—" cells are preserved verbatim (p57; eshyra-0m9.23). |
| Standard Languages | `table:standard-languages` | Eight language/speakers/script rows split by known language prefix + last-token script, so a multi-word speakers cell ("Ogres, giants") stays intact (p59; eshyra-0m9.23). |
| Exotic Languages | `table:exotic-languages` | Eight rows split the same way; the two-word "Deep Speech" language and its "—" script cell are handled by the known-name prefix match (p59; eshyra-0m9.23). |
| Standard Exchange Rates | `table:standard-exchange-rates` | Five coin rows ("Copper (cp) 1 1/10 …") reconstruct from line text; fractional cross-rate cells are preserved verbatim as strings. Anchored on the unique "Coin CP SP EP GP PP" header because the title also appears as a section heading (p62; eshyra-0m9.19). |
| Trade Goods | `table:trade-goods` | Thirteen cost/goods rows; the leading number+denomination ("1 cp", "500 gp") is the cost and the remainder the goods. Anchored on the "Cost Goods" header (p72; eshyra-0m9.19). |
| Lifestyle Expenses | `table:lifestyle-expenses` | Seven lifestyle/price rows anchored on the known lifestyle name so the value cell keeps "—" (Wretched) and "10 gp minimum" (Aristocratic) verbatim (pp72-73; eshyra-0m9.19). |
| Food, Drink, and Lodging | `table:food-drink-and-lodging` | Twenty rows. The SRD prints grouped sub-headings (Ale, Inn stay, Meals, Wine) with indented sub-items; a reviewed group→members map folds each sub-item into a qualified name ("Inn stay, squalid (per day)") and ungrouped items (Banquet, Bread, Cheese, Meat) keep their bare name. Values come from extraction; only the grouping is reviewed (pp73-74; eshyra-0m9.19). |
| Services | `table:services` | Seven rows, grouped the same way (Coach cab, Hireling) with three ungrouped services. A value-less line that is not a known group header bounds the table, dropping the trailing explanatory prose (p74; eshyra-0m9.19). |
| Multiclass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level | `table:multiclass-spellcaster-spell-slots-per-spell-level` | Twenty ordinal-level rows of nine slot cells each. Anchored on the unique first caption line "Multiclass Spellcaster:" (the trailing colon keeps the wrapped body-prose mention "consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table." from matching). Slot counts emit as integers; the "no slots at this level" em-dash cells are preserved verbatim (p58; eshyra-0m9.18). |
| Size Categories | `table:size-categories` | Six size/space/examples rows from the Monsters chapter (p254; eshyra-0m9.22). The caption is shared with the core-rules Combat chapter's two-column Size/Space table (p92), and both captions appear in the concatenated `parseTables` input, so the parser anchors on the Monsters version's unique three-column header row ("Size Space Examples"). The core p92 occurrence is not emitted. |
| Hit Dice by Size | `table:hit-dice-by-size` | Six size/hit-die/average rows; the half-point averages ("2½" … "10½") are preserved verbatim (p256; eshyra-0m9.22). |
| Proficiency Bonus by Challenge Rating | `table:proficiency-bonus-by-challenge-rating` | Thirty-four challenge/bonus rows printed as PAIRED columns — each physical line carries two logical rows ("1/8 +2 15 +5"). A four-group row regex splits each line; every left pair emits in document order followed by every right pair so rows run CR 0 → 30 (p256; eshyra-0m9.22). |
| Experience Points by Challenge Rating | `table:experience-points-by-challenge-rating` | Thirty-four challenge/XP rows, paired-column like the proficiency table. XP cells are verbatim strings (thousands separators kept; the CR 0 cell is the SRD's prose "0 or 10") (p258; eshyra-0m9.22). |

The committed pack holds exactly these twenty-five reconstructed `table`
records plus the four Acolyte suggested-characteristics roll tables emitted by
`parseBackgrounds` (29 `table` records total). `srdGeneratedPack.test.ts` pins
the table key/name set (and the per-kind `table: 29` count) so coverage cannot
silently collapse or grow without a reviewed baseline update.

The core-rules Combat chapter's own "Size Categories" table (p92, Size/Space
only) is an intentional omission: its Space cells are identical to the
Monsters-chapter `table:size-categories` (p254), which is a strict superset
(it adds the Examples column), so emitting the p92 occurrence would only
duplicate the same data under a colliding key (eshyra-10t).

The Beyond-1st-Level tables (Character Advancement, Multiclassing Prerequisites,
Multiclassing Proficiencies, Standard Languages, Exotic Languages, Multiclass
Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level) are
reconstructed from the dedicated `beyondFirstLevel` section slice; each table
title and column-header line is unique within that chapter, so the per-table
anchors cannot collide with the wrapped body-prose mentions ("as shown in the
Character / Advancement table"). The same slice feeds `parseRules` for the
chapter's prose rules (eshyra-0m9.18; see the `rule` row above). The money/downtime tables (Standard Exchange
Rates, Trade Goods, Lifestyle Expenses, Food/Drink/Lodging, Services) are
reconstructed from the `equipment` slice (Standard Exchange Rates) and the
dedicated `expenses` slice (the rest), and anchored on their unique
column-header lines because each title also occurs as a section heading.
The Spellcasting Services subsection in the same `expenses` slice has no rate
table, so it is emitted as a `rule` (`rule:spellcasting-services`) via
`parseSpellcastingServices`, not as a table.

### Reconstruction-capable but absent from SRD 5.1

These are DM-reference / encounter-building tables that the Creative-Commons SRD
5.1 does **not** include (they live in non-SRD sourcebooks). The parser keeps a
reviewed reconstruction rule for each, exercised by `parseTables.test.ts` unit
fixtures and the `pipeline.test.ts` end-to-end fixture, so a future SRD edition —
or any other source — that *does* carry them is imported without new parser
work. None of them emit a record from the vendored SRD 5.1 PDF.

| Table | Record key | Reconstruction rule |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| XP Thresholds by Character Level | `table:xp-thresholds-by-character-level` | Fixed five-column numeric threshold rows reconstruct cleanly from line text. |
| Individual Treasure challenge tables | `table:individual-treasure-challenge-<range>` | The `treasureTables` slice is wired through `runImporter`; d100 ranges form a leading block and each currency column forms an equal-length block that can be pivoted into rows. |
| Treasure Hoard challenge tables | `table:treasure-hoard-challenge-<range>` | The `treasureTables` slice is wired through `runImporter`; d100 ranges, coin columns, gems/art-object column, and magic-item column can be reconstructed from equal-length column blocks. Empty dash cells are stored as `null`. |

Tables not covered by the current parser at all:

| Table family | Reason deferred | Follow-up |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Other wide/nested DM reference tables | `loreweaver-0m9.5.13` does not claim all SRD tables. Add a dedicated anchor and reconstruction rule before emitting each additional table family; tables whose text wraps within cells may need raw pdfjs x/y positions rather than `PageText.lines` alone. | Create a follow-up from the full-PDF coverage audit with the exact table fixture. |

## Section-anchor table

The SRD 5.1 PDF is a single multi-chapter document; each kind parser is only
correct against its own chapter. `sections.ts` exposes a small table of
chapter-heading regexes that the orchestrator uses to narrow input before
dispatch. Each entry is a `SectionAnchorOptions` value:

| Field                | Purpose                                                                                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `startHeading`       | Regex matched against `line.trim()` to find the section's first content line (heading itself excluded). |
| `endHeading`         | Regex matched against any line after `startHeading` to mark the boundary (end line excluded).         |
| `requireEndHeading`  | If `true`, an unmatched `endHeading` throws `SectionNotFoundError('end')` instead of slicing to EOF.   |
| `matchHeadings`     | If `true`, anchors match only at the line positions the extractor flagged as chapter/section headings (`PageText.headingLineIndexes` — indexes into `lines`, not just heading text). Disambiguates a chapter title from a body-font line that happens to spell the same text — e.g. "Equipment" appears as a class-block subsection at body font in every base-class chapter, and a text-only check could not tell those two occurrences apart. Fixtures with uniform font sizes leave `headingLineIndexes` undefined and fall back to line matching. |

`SRD_5_1_DEFAULT_SECTION_ANCHORS` is the live table consumed by the
orchestrator. Freestanding `table` records use the `coreRules` slice for the
Difficulty Classes table, the `traps` slice for the two trap tables, the
`treasureTables` slice for treasure challenge tables, the `beyondFirstLevel`
slice (p56-60, best-effort start, end-bounded at "Backgrounds") for the six
Beyond-1st-Level reference tables (eshyra-0m9.23, eshyra-0m9.18) AND the
chapter's 18 prose rules (eshyra-0m9.18), the `equipment` slice for
Standard Exchange Rates (p62), and the `expenses` slice (p72-74, best-effort
start, end-bounded at "Feats") for Trade Goods, Lifestyle Expenses,
Food/Drink/Lodging, and Services plus the Spellcasting Services rule
(eshyra-0m9.19). The four Acolyte suggested-characteristics roll tables come
from `parseBackgrounds` over the `backgrounds` slice (pp60-61, best-effort
start, end-bounded at "Equipment"), not from `parseTables` — the SRD prints
them caption-less, so their names are synthesized (eshyra-0m9.17); the same
slice yields the `background:acolyte` record and (via a
`truncateBeforeFirst(/^Acolyte$/)` sub-slice) the chapter's six intro rules.
The `traps` anchor is
best-effort on its START (a fixture without a Traps section degrades to no
traps) but `requireEndHeading: true`, so a Traps section that begins without
its `Diseases` boundary fails closed rather than letting the last trap's body
run on (the contamination loreweaver-7ok removed from Zone of Truth). Two other
anchors (`hazards`, `treasureTables`) target sections that do NOT exist in the
SRD 5.1 PDF; the orchestrator wraps those slices in a best-effort try/catch and
emits empty results when the start anchor doesn't match, so a missing canonical
section is not a run-time failure.

Real-PDF mapping note (`loreweaver-0m9.5.20`): the SRD 5.1 has no aggregate
"Classes" chapter heading; each base class is its own h=25.9 chapter title
("Barbarian" through "Wizard"). Multi-line chapter titles ("Using Ability" +
"Scores", "Appendix PH-A:" + "Conditions") are re-joined into a single
logical line by the extractor's heading-merge pass before slicing.

Anchors are deliberately tight (`^...$`) so a body-prose mention of a chapter
title can't false-positive. Tests in `test/importers/dnd5e-srd-5.1/sections.test.ts`
cover both the happy paths and the fail-closed behavior. Callers can override
the live table via the `sectionAnchors` option on `runImporter` -- useful if a
future vendored PDF uses variant heading text.

## Adding a new record kind

To add a parser for a new kind (e.g. creatures, classes, conditions):

1. **Add a new anchor entry** to `SRD_5_1_DEFAULT_SECTION_ANCHORS` in
   `sections.ts` (and to `Srd51SectionAnchors`). Pick regexes that match the
   exact chapter heading text observed in the vendored PDF. Default to
   `requireEndHeading: true` unless the section legitimately runs to EOF --
   failing closed is the whole point of the slicer.
2. **Write the kind parser** under `scripts/importers/dnd5e-srd-5.1/` (e.g.
   `parseCreatures.ts`). It must accept a narrowed `readonly PageText[]` --
   never re-slice the full PDF. The parser is responsible only for its
   chapter's grammar; the orchestrator guarantees the input doesn't span
   adjacent chapters.
3. **Wire the orchestrator**: in `runImporter` (`index.ts`), call
   `sliceSection(pages, anchors.<newKind>)` and pass the result to the new
   parser. Feed its output into `buildPack`.
4. **Update `emit.ts` / `buildPack`** if the new kind requires a new
   record-builder branch.
5. **Add tests**: unit tests for the parser (against inline SRD text excerpts,
   like `parseSpells.test.ts`), an anchor sanity test in `sections.test.ts`,
   and an end-to-end fixture page in `pipeline.test.ts` exercising the new
   slice through the orchestrator. The pipeline test should also assert that
   text from the new chapter does not bleed into adjacent kinds (and vice
   versa).
6. **Update the "Scope today" table** above when the new kind ships.

Per the `loreweaver-0m9.5` scope rule, the importer must not emit empty stubs
for kinds it does not yet cover -- landing a stub parser without real
extraction would let the generated pack pose as more complete than it is.

## Source-structure coverage gate

The importer is self-auditing against the source PDF (eshyra-4a7.1): every
source structure the PDF's own typography identifies must be accounted for,
or the import refuses to write a pack.

**Inventory** (`sourceInventory.ts`): a pure scan of the extracted
`PageText[]` driven by per-line rendered font heights (`lineHeights`).
Measured tier map for the vendored `SRD_CC_v5.1.pdf`:

| height | tier         | examples                                              |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ≈25.9  | `chapter`    | chapter titles, class names                           |
| ≈18.0  | `section`    | section titles ("Spell Lists", "Sacred Oaths")        |
| ≈13.9  | `subsection` | subsection headings, subclass names                   |
| ≈12.0  | `leaf`       | spells, magic items, creatures, features, captions    |
| ≈10.8  | `sidebar`    | gray callout-box headings                             |
| ≈10.0  | (excluded)   | page-1/2 legal front matter                           |
| ≈9.8   | (excluded)   | body prose                                            |
| ≈8.9   | table cells  | become `table-shape` runs / `table-caption` evidence  |

Structural classification on top of the tiers: a heading followed by a
size/type/alignment line is a `stat-block`; a heading followed by
table-cell-height lines is a `table-caption`; a table-cell run not owned by a
caption is a `table-shape` item of its own.

**Coverage** (`sourceInventoryCoverage.ts`): every inventory item resolves to
exactly one status — name auto-match against the emitted records first, then
the curated `SRD_5_1_COVERAGE_RULES` (first match wins), then a
document-structure default for unmatched chapter/section tiers, else
`unaccounted`, which makes `runImporter` throw before writing anything. The
gate is opt-in per run (`RunImporterInput.sourceCoverageRules`) because
fixture PDFs render at one body size and carry no tier signal; the CLI and
`verify:dnd5e-srd-pack` always pass the curated rules.

**Artifacts**: a gated run writes two review artifacts next to the pack
files (the pack loader reads only `manifest.json`/`records.json` by name and
tolerates them):

- `source-inventory.json` — the raw inventory:
  `[{ page, lineIndex, text, tier, structure, section, context }, …]`.
- `source-coverage.json` — `{ summary, entries }` where `summary` rolls up
  counts (per ignore reason and per known-gap bead) and each entry carries
  the item's locator fields plus a one-line `status`:
  `record:<key>` | `child-of:<key>` | `ignored:<reason>` |
  `known-gap:<beadId>` | `unaccounted`.

**Rule curation lifecycle**: rules are predicates over understood classes of
source structure, never per-item allowlists. `ignored` is reserved for
genuine non-content (e.g. spell-list level headers; equipment tables whose
rows ARE the equipment records) and documented intentional exclusions.
Anything that should become a record or child data is a
`known-gap:<beadId>` pointing at the bead that will close it — when that
bead lands and starts emitting the records, the auto-match claims the items,
the known-gap rule is REMOVED, the canonical artifacts are regenerated, and
the sentinel tests in `srdSourceInventoryArtifact.test.ts` are updated in
the same change. Leaving a stale known-gap rule in place would let a future
regression of that coverage pass silently.

`verify:dnd5e-srd-pack` byte-diffs the regenerated artifacts against the
committed copies (the same exact-match contract as `records.json`), and the
audit bundle copies both artifacts into `reports/` with the accounting
summary in `metadata.json`. The hand-curated name lists in
`sourceCoverage.ts` remain as an independent source-truth regression net;
the typography inventory is the structural superset that also catches
structures nobody has listed yet.

## Determinism

The importer is deterministic in two senses:

- **Byte-stable output**: given identical input PDF bytes, two runs produce
  byte-identical `manifest.json` + `records.json` files. `JSON.stringify`
  preserves object insertion order; the record builder uses literal field
  order; `Map.set` insertion order is also preserved.
- **Source pin**: the PDF's SHA-256 is computed and embedded in
  `manifest.json` under `source.sourceHash`, so any byte-level swap of the
  source artifact is detectable on the next run.

## Testing

- `packages/core/test/importers/dnd5e-srd-5.1/parseSpells.test.ts` -- unit
  tests for the spell parser against inline real SRD 5.1 spell text excerpts
  (used under CC-BY-4.0; attribution preserved in the test file header).
- `packages/core/test/importers/dnd5e-srd-5.1/emit.test.ts` -- emitter
  determinism: two passes over the same input produce byte-identical files;
  output passes `validateRulesPack`.
- `packages/core/test/importers/dnd5e-srd-5.1/parseTables.test.ts` -- unit
  tests for the freestanding table parser, including Madness wrapped rows,
  both Object Hit Points extraction layouts, trap/DC tables, treasure
  column-block reconstruction, and incomplete tables that must fail closed.
- `packages/core/test/importers/dnd5e-srd-5.1/parseGamemasteringRules.test.ts`
  -- unit tests for the five Madness/Objects prose records and table-row
  exclusion.
- `packages/core/test/importers/dnd5e-srd-5.1/pipeline.test.ts` -- end-to-end
  test against a small fixture PDF generated at test time via `pdfkit`, to
  exercise the full extract -> parse -> emit pipeline without requiring the
  full SRD PDF to be present. The fixture includes a bounded treasure section
  so `runImporter` must emit both individual-treasure and treasure-hoard table
  records.
