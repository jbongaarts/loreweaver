/**
 * PDF text extraction for the D&D 5e SRD 5.1 importer.
 *
 * Uses pdfjs-dist's "legacy" Node-friendly build to extract per-page text
 * content. The extractor groups text items into lines by their y-coordinate
 * (in PDF user space, origin at lower-left of the page) and sorts each line
 * left-to-right by x-coordinate.
 *
 * Column-aware emission: SRD 5.1 body chapters (spell descriptions, monster
 * stat blocks, …) render in two columns. pdfjs returns items in y-descending
 * order regardless of column, and items from both columns can share an
 * identical y-baseline (a wrap line at the bottom of one column lines up
 * exactly with a stat-block heading at the top of the next column on the
 * facing column). A naïve "bucket by y first" pass therefore concatenates
 * across columns into a single line ("… one Speed 40 ft., …"), erasing the
 * Speed row entirely. The extractor partitions ITEMS by x BEFORE bucketing
 * by y, then emits column-by-column (top-to-bottom within each column,
 * left-to-right between columns), which yields the natural reading order
 * with each column's contents kept intact. Pages whose item x values
 * collapse to a single cluster are emitted in their original y-descending
 * order, so single-column body pages and fixture PDFs are unaffected.
 *
 * Heading awareness: the SRD 5.1 PDF renders chapter titles ("Races",
 * "Equipment", "Using Ability Scores", "Appendix PH-A: Conditions") at a
 * larger font height than body prose. The extractor identifies items with
 * height ≥ `HEADING_H_THRESHOLD` as heading-class. Two consequences:
 *
 *   1. Multi-line chapter titles (e.g. "Using Ability" wrapping to "Scores"
 *      below it because the column is narrow) are merged back into a single
 *      logical line so `^Using Ability Scores$` anchors actually match.
 *
 *   2. Each `PageText` carries a `headingLineIndexes` array — indexes into
 *      `lines` for entries the extractor identified as chapter / section
 *      headings. The section slicer can opt into matching anchors only at
 *      these positions (see `matchHeadings` in `sections.ts`), so an
 *      `^Equipment$` line that appears as a class-block subsection at body
 *      font size does not shadow the actual "Equipment" chapter title even
 *      when their trimmed text is identical.
 *
 * Pure function: same PDF buffer always yields the same `PageText[]`.

 * Rendered, the cluster looks like a single hyphen, but the raw extracted text
 * carries the whole run — e.g. "appendix PH-A", "10-year-old", "self- expression".
 * Left in place these invisible code points (1) break parser regexes that
 * expect a lone ASCII hyphen (the `LEVELED_MARKER` spell-heading miss in
 * loreweaver-qqc, the dropped compound creature names in loreweaver-w8h) and
 * (2) leak into the durable generated pack as hidden-Unicode artifacts
 * (loreweaver-6uy). Collapsing any run of these four code points to a single
 * ASCII hyphen normalizes heading detection AND body text in one place, at the
 * extraction boundary, so each parser no longer has to re-derive the same fix.
 *
 * The character class is written with explicit `\uXXXX` escapes so this source
 * file never embeds the invisible code points the normalization is about. Lines
 * that already carry a plain ASCII hyphen round-trip unchanged; en-dash (U+2013)

 * return a single bucket containing all items, so single-column pages and

 *
 * Why item-level (not row-level) partitioning: a row spanning two columns
 * (the previous spell's wrap line in the left column at the same y as the
 * next spell's name in the right column) shares a y-bucket only because
 * the items happen to share an identical baseline. Splitting at the item
 * level keeps each column's reading order intact — the merged-text "Breath
 * Weapons … one Speed 40 ft., …" was the exact symptom of partitioning
 * after y-bucketing rather than before.
 *
 * Cut selection: we consider every x-gap that clears
 * `COLUMN_GAP_THRESHOLD` and keep only those where each side passes the
 * per-side guards (item count + distinct-x diversity). Among the
 * surviving cuts we normally keep the widest gap, except when that cut leaves
 * only a tiny outlier island on one side. Why not just the single absolute largest
 * gap, validate, and bail on failure (the prior approach): on monster
 * pages a far-right outlier item (e.g. a stray "The" at x=539 next to a
 * right-column body at x=329) creates an isolated x-gap of ~90pt that
 * exceeds the real gutter (~78pt at x≈251→329). The absolute-largest cut
 * lands at the outlier, the right side fails the MIN_ITEMS guard, and
 * the whole page falls back to unpartitioned y-bucketing — interleaving
 * the two columns line-by-line and silently dropping ~50% of creature
 * stat blocks (loreweaver-w8h). Scanning all qualifying gaps and keeping
 * only valid ones survives the outlier and still rejects intra-column
 * label/value tabbing (those gaps fail the distinct-x guard on both
 * sides — single label x, single value x — so they're filtered out).
 *
 * Gutter-straggler correction (`reassignGutterStragglers`, applied to the
 * chosen split): the SRD 5.1 body justifies paragraphs, so each paragraph's
 * last word is pushed flush to its column's right edge. A left-column last
 * word can therefore land close to the gutter, and the widest valid gap on
 * the page may be an internal left-column gap whose midpoint falls to the
 * LEFT of that word — sweeping it into the right column, where it buckets by
 * y between real right-column lines and scrambles reading order. SRD 5.1 p193
 * (end of the "Wish" spell): the widest valid gap is the internal left-column
 * gap 162→242 (midpoint ≈202), left of the right-aligned word "wish" (x≈259);
 * "wish" was swept into the right column and interleaved into "Word of
 * Recall"'s body (loreweaver-7ok). The correction moves such lone stragglers
 * back to the left column. It keys off line-start DENSITY rather than gap
 * width because the true right-column margin (x≈328.6 throughout the SRD,
 * 24–48 line-starts) is unmistakable next to a one-off justified word, while
 * gap width alone cannot tell the two apart on a justified page.

  // pattern without touching real columns. Unlike the tiny-island contiguity

  // conditions that each rule out a different real two-column page whose widest
  // cut happens to read as contiguous:
  //   - The widest cut must also be the most balanced one on the page
  //     (`widestMinSideItems >= supportedMinSideItems`). On SRD 5.1 p238 (Robe
  //     of Eyes) and p226 (Immovable Rod | Horn of Valhalla) the WIDEST gap is a
  //     mid-line italic/embedded-table run rather than the real gutter, so the
  //     real gutter is a strictly more balanced cut and the page is not merged.
  //   - The right side of the cut must have NO standalone line
  //     (`rightSideHasStandaloneLine` false): every right-side item shares its
  //     baseline with a left-side item. On the SRD 5.1 p63 armor table the
  //     AC→Strength cut reads as contiguous (the AC cell ends ≈20pt from the
  //     Strength column) and is the most balanced cut, but the right side owns
  //     the real right-hand prose column on its own baselines, so it stays split.
  // The sparse single-column p205 Sample Poisons page is the one case that
  // satisfies both: its only cut is the most balanced, and its right side is
  // purely lead-in remainders sharing the left lead-ins' baselines.
