/**
 * Live-API faithfulness proof for the campaign bible (loreweaver-q0d).
 *
 * The deterministic tests in `campaignBibleExtractor.test.ts` prove the
 * *input shape* is right — the prior bible appears in the user content and
 * the system prompt carries the no-omit instruction. This test proves the
 * model actually honors that instruction across multiple iterations.
 *
 * Scenario: a single named NPC (Mira the runesmith) is introduced in
 * session-1 and never mentioned again across sessions 2-10. At each
 * iteration we re-extract the bible, feeding the previous iteration's
 * output back in as `priorBible` — the same pattern the CLI uses at every
 * arc-rollover (loreweaver-1jv). The faithfulness contract says Mira must
 * still appear in `majorNpcs` after iteration 10.
 *
 * Like `model.integration.test.ts`, this test is gated on
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and is part of the documented set of always-skipped
 * tests when no provider key is supplied (see `AGENTS.md`).
