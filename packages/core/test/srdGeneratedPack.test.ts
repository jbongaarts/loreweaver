/**
 * Default-on coverage and audit tests for the committed D&D 5e SRD 5.1
 * rules-pack at `packages/core/data/rules-packs/rules__dnd5e-srd-5.1/`.
 *
 * These tests operate on the COMMITTED pack on disk — not on importer output.
 * Per the 0m9.6 design, the importer is treated as a one-shot construction
 * tool. Continuously re-running it on every PR is the path-gated
 * `verify:dnd5e-srd-pack` job's responsibility, not vitest's.
 *
 * What this file guards:
 *   - The committed pack still loads and validates.
 *   - Per-kind counts match the canonical full-pack baseline literal
 *     (loreweaver-1pw replaced the two-record seed pack with the importer's
 *     full deterministic output from the vendored SRD 5.1 PDF).
 *   - Key shape is consistent and unique.
 *   - A representative stable key from every kind is present.
 *   - The generic `auditPack` heuristic surfaces no suspicious records, and the
 *     set of partially-populated optional data fields matches an explicitly
 *     reviewed baseline (these are genuinely-optional SRD fields — e.g. a spell
 *     `ritual` flag or an ancestry `subraces` list — present on some records of
 *     a kind and absent on others, not parser drift).
 *   - The pack's license/source manifest aligns with the vendored source
 *     manifest at `packages/core/sources/dnd5e-srd-5.1/manifest.json`.
 *
 * Out of scope (see bead notes):
 *   - Exact creature name-set validation → `loreweaver-0m9.5.14`.
 *   - Pathfinder coverage → `loreweaver-0m9.9`.

  // SRD 5.1 feature heading:
  //   curly apostrophe (U+2019) headings — feature:circle-of-the-land:lands-stride
  //   (6th), :natures-ward (10th), :natures-sanctuary (14th);
  //   feature:hunter:hunters-prey (3rd), :superior-hunters-defense (15th);

  //   feature:thief:thiefs-reflexes (17th); feature:ranger:lands-stride (8th).
  //   colon heading — feature:life-domain:channel-divinity-preserve-life (2nd).
  //   "Also starting at …" lead-in — feature:life-domain:disciple-of-life (1st);
  //   feature:college-of-lore:cutting-words (3rd, "Also at 3rd level").
  //   "By Nth level …" lead-in — feature:thief:use-magic-device (13th);
  //   feature:rogue:reliable-talent (11th), :slippery-mind (15th).
  //   second-sentence / enumerated grant clause — feature:circle-of-the-land:
  //   circle-spells (3rd, "At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level"); feature:
  //   draconic-bloodline:draconic-resilience (1st, "At 1st level" after an
  //   intro sentence).
  // 165 -> 167 (eshyra-0m9.14): the progression-table row-stitching fix merges
  // feature cells that wrap across two extracted lines back onto their row
  // before feature detection. Two SRD 5.1 base-class features whose ONLY grant
  // cell wrapped were previously truncated in the table and so swallowed into
  // the preceding feature's body; they are now emitted as their own records:
  //   feature:sorcerer:sorcerous-origin (1st; "Spellcasting, Sorcerous" + wrap
  //   "Origin") and feature:warlock:pact-magic (1st; "Otherworldly Patron, Pact"
  //   + wrap "Magic"). The same fix also corrects two existing records in place
  //   (no count change): feature:fighter:indomitable is renamed from the bogus
  //   feature:fighter:indomitable-three-uses (the wrapped 17th-level repeated-use
  //   cell was mistaken for the canonical heading), and the earliest-grant levels
  //   of feature:druid:ability-score-improvement (12 -> 4) and
  //   feature:bard:magical-secrets (14 -> 10) now come from their wrapped first
  //   grant rows rather than a later un-wrapped row.
  // 167 -> 169 (eshyra-tzl): two subclass features whose grant level is stated
  // by a subclass-entry lead-in the parser did not recognize are now emitted at
  // their 3rd-level grant. Each lead-in occurs exactly once in the SRD 5.1
  // Classes chapter:
  //   feature:college-of-lore:bonus-proficiencies (3rd, "When you join the
  //   College of Lore at 3rd level …") and feature:oath-of-devotion:channel-
  //   divinity (3rd, "When you take this oath at 3rd level …", carrying the
  //   Sacred Weapon and Turn the Unholy options). Emitting the latter is
  //   consistent with the existing Channel Divinity feature precedent
  //   (feature:cleric:channel-divinity, feature:life-domain:channel-divinity-
  //   preserve-life). The subclass blurbs are produced by parseSubclasses and
  //   are unchanged.
  // 169 -> 183 (eshyra-7tc + eshyra-ai9): the Classes slice begins AFTER the
  // "Barbarian" chapter heading (it is the `classes` section-anchor start
  // boundary, excluded from the slice), so parseFeatures opened no class context
  // for the Barbarian body and dropped every Barbarian base-class feature.
  // parseFeatures now opens implicit Barbarian class context at the start of the
  // slice (mirroring parseSubclasses' `currentParent = 'Barbarian'` default),
  // recovering all 14 SRD 5.1 Barbarian base features: feature:barbarian:rage
  // (1), :unarmored-defense (1), :reckless-attack (2), :danger-sense (2),
  // :primal-path (3), :ability-score-improvement (4), :extra-attack (5),
  // :fast-movement (5), :feral-instinct (7), :brutal-critical (9),
  // :relentless-rage (11), :persistent-rage (15), :indomitable-might (18),
  // :primal-champion (20). Unarmored Defense (1st) required a second fix
  // (eshyra-ai9): the Barbarian table is the only SRD 5.1 class table whose
  // Features column is followed by numeric columns (Rages, Rage Damage), so its
  // 1st-level row extracts with those numerics interleaved before the wrapped
  // cell remainder ("1st +2 Rage, 2 +2" | "Unarmored" | "Defense"). Row-stitching
  // now strips the trailing numeric columns before joining the continuation,
  // reuniting the cell as "Rage, Unarmored Defense"; both Rage and Unarmored
  // Defense emit at level 1 with source-bounded descriptions (Rage's body no
  // longer absorbs the Unarmored Defense heading/body).

 *   - ancestry.subraceOf / subraces: only subraces carry `subraceOf`; only
 *     races-with-subraces carry `subraces`.
 *   - creature.category: only the 21 Appendix MM-B NPC stat blocks carry
 *     `category: 'npc'`; the 296 Monsters/Appendix MM-A creatures omit it (its
 *     absence means "monster") so they stay byte-identical to the pre-NPC pack
 *     (loreweaver-bn0).
 *   - creature.{conditionImmunities,damageImmunities,damageResistances,
 *     damageVulnerabilities,savingThrows,skills}: optional keyed stat-block
 *     fields emitted only when the SRD prints that label for the creature
 *     (eshyra-ez6v / eshyra-4a7.5). `senses` and `languages` are fully populated
 *     (all 317 stat blocks carry them), so they are not partial and not listed.
 *   - creature.{traits,actions,reactions,legendaryActions}: optional narrative
 *     body sections emitted only when the creature prints that section
 *     (eshyra-yevt / eshyra-4a7.5).
 *   - condition.effects: present on all conditions except Exhaustion, whose
 *     mechanics live in its per-level `levels` table.
 *   - condition.levels: only Exhaustion has graded levels.
 *   - equipment.{ac,armorType,stealthDisadvantage,strengthRequirement}: armor-
 *     only fields (13 armor records); strengthRequirement only the 3 heavy
 *     armors that list a Str minimum.
 *   - equipment.{damageDie,damageType,properties}: weapon-only fields (37
 *     weapons); damageDie/damageType absent on the Net, whose damage cell is a
 *     dash, while every weapon carries a (possibly empty) properties list.
 *   - equipment.capacity: Container Capacity, attached to the 13 gear
 *     containers (loreweaver-4zu).
 *   - equipment.{speed,carryingCapacity}: Mounts and Vehicles fields —
 *     `speed` on the 8 mounts + 6 waterborne vehicles (14), `carryingCapacity`
 *     on the 8 mounts only (loreweaver-4zu).
 *   - equipment.description: the 7 Equipment Pack bundles (their verbatim
 *     contents sentence); no other equipment record carries a description
 *     (loreweaver-4zu).
 *   - equipment.weight: absent on the 44 records the SRD lists with no weight
 *     cell — the items with a "—" weight (Sling, gaming sets, and many
 *     adventuring-gear/tack rows) plus the 7 packs, 8 mounts, and 6 waterborne
 *     vehicles (priced by speed/capacity, not weight).
 *   - hazard.{category,poisonType,price,trapType}: the `hazard` kind holds three
 *     gamemastering sub-families (loreweaver-6ra). The 8 traps carry `trapType`;
 *     the 3 diseases + 14 poisons carry `category` ('disease'/'poison'); the 14
 *     poisons additionally carry `poisonType` and `price`. Every hazard record
 *     still carries the required `description`.
 *   - magic-item.attunementRequirement: only the 26 items whose category line
 *     restricts attunement by class, ancestry, alignment, or spellcasting carry
 *     this text; all 239 records still carry the boolean `requiresAttunement`.
 *   - spell.componentMaterials: only spells with a material (M) component.
 *   - spell.higherLevels: only spells with an "At Higher Levels" entry.
 *   - spell.ritual: only spells tagged as rituals.
 * The audit reports `0 < missingCount < totalInKind` per field; we pin the
 * compact {kind, field, missingCount, totalInKind} projection so a new
 * partially-populated field (a real drift signal) fails the test, while the
