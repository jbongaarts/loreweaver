/**
 * Loader for generated rules-pack artifacts stored on disk.
 *
 * ## Generated data layout
 *
 * Generated (and seed) rules-pack artifacts live under:
 *
 *   packages/core/data/rules-packs/<packId-safe>/
 *     manifest.json   — RulesPackMeta (minus `order` / `dependsOn`; those are
 *                       runtime-only and are not persisted to disk)
 *     records.json    — RulesRecord[]  (one flat array; importers may generate
 *                       this in any order; the loader sorts by `key` before
 *                       returning so output is always deterministic)
 *
 * `<packId-safe>` is the pack identifier with every `:` replaced by `__`
 * (double underscore) so the directory name is valid on all platforms
 * (Windows NTFS forbids `:` in file/directory names).  For example, the pack
 * `rules:dnd5e-srd-5.1` lives in `rules__dnd5e-srd-5.1/`.  The canonical
 * `packId` is stored inside `manifest.json`, not derived from the directory.
 * Pack IDs must not contain path separators.
 *
 * Both files are required.  `validateRulesPack` runs over the merged object so
 * all existing invariants (source xor identity, per-record provenance match,
 * per-kind shape checks) are enforced on every load.
 *
 * When this package is published, the `data/` directory is included in
 * `files` in `package.json` alongside `dist/`, so consumers that install
 * `@loreweaver/core` from npm get the seed packs pre-populated.
 *
 * ## Loader guarantee
 *
 * Given identical files on disk, `loadRulesPackFromDirectory` always returns a
 * value that is deeply equal (same `packId`, same records in the same order,
 * same field values).  Stability is achieved by:
 *   1. Sorting records by `key` (lexicographic, UTF-16 code unit order) after
 *      parsing, before returning.
 *   2. `JSON.parse` preserves object-property insertion order in all V8
 *      versions that Node 22 uses, so per-field order within a record is
 *      stable across runs.
